### How to run Application? ###

A single command to run the frontend & backend below.

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```
I used many kinds of external libraries for server and ui.

* Server
1. node-cache: I preferred this library because each request must be cached according to challenge requirements.
2. babel: I coded server with es6 and for transformation.
3. node-fetch: Instead of implementing XMLHttpRequest in Node.js to run browser-specific
4. babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy: 
5. babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread: 

* ui
1. redux
2. redux-saga

# The time you spent on the challenge
I spent 3 days on the challange.
